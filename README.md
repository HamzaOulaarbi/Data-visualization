Interactive visualization
this is an example of building interactive visualization to compare the average of four features over 4 years.
we use a bar chart with 95% confidence intervals representing the mean values, the goal is to compare the means per year to a threshold. The threshold is specified by the user by clicking on the figure. 

An additional button permits to reinitialize the threshold specified.
